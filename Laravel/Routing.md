# Laravel Routing

The essential function of any web application framework is to take requests from a
user and deliver responses, usually via HTTP(S). This means defining an application’s
routes is the first and most important project to tackle when learning a web frame‐
work; without routes, you have little to no ability to interact with the end user.

**MVC**

Model: Represents an individual database table (or a record from that table)

View: Represents the template that outputs your data to the end user like Login page

Controller: Takes HTTP requests from the browser, gets the right data out of the database and other storage mechanisms, validates user input, and eventually sends a response back to the user.
